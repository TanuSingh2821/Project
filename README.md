# React Table UI (Figma Inspired)

Hey!  
This is a custom *editable table UI* built using *React, **Tailwind CSS, and **TypeScript*.  
Inspired by Figma's clean and minimal table layout — practical, neat, and fully interactive.

You can click to edit cells, see grouped column headers with icons, and scroll through 100+ rows.  
I built this as part of an internship project to get more comfortable with dynamic UIs and to improve my React + Tailwind skills.
